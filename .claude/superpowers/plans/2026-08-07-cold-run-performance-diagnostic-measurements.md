# Cold-Run Performance Diagnostic: Measurements

Spec: `.claude/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-cold-run-performance-diagnostic-design.md`
Machine: the reference 10-core machine used by every published figure
Corpus: pinned PrestaShop comparison corpus
(`fc96d0d4eae383e8c6f1f54f19cf592c221a62e3`), equalized file set
Binary: `target/release/celerrate`, built at commit `2621b81`

## Protocol

- Cold run: `rm -rf .celerrate` in the corpus directory, then
  `../../release/celerrate check .` from the corpus directory.
- Three repetitions minimum per measurement point; medians reported.
- Session discipline: machine otherwise idle; every A/B measured back
  to back in one session; each session opens and closes with a control
  (three cold `check` runs, median recorded); a control drift above
  ~10 % between open and close invalidates the session's comparisons.
- Every figure carries its session date, commit, and spread.

## 1. Session anchor (Task 1)

Date: 2026-08-07
Commit: `2621b81`
Command: `cargo xtask benchmark`
Machine: otherwise idle for the whole run

| Scenario  | Cold median | Standard deviation | Timed runs |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| PHPStan   | 32.652 s    | ± 1.633 s            | 3          |
| Celerrate | 4.945 s     | ± 0.379 s            | 5          |

Cold ratio (PHPStan median divided by Celerrate median): 6.6x.

Both medians land inside their historical bands (PHPStan 31 s to 39 s;
Celerrate 4.8 s to 5.5 s), which is consistent with an idle machine at
measurement time. The file-count cross-check also matched exactly
(6932 reported, 6932 counted independently), confirming the equal-file-set
invariant held for this run.

This measurement is the campaign's opening reference: the session anchor
against which later sessions are compared. Any later task in this
campaign that cites a figure measured in a different session must say so
explicitly; a cross-session figure is not directly comparable to a
same-session figure without that disclosure.
