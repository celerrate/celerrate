# Schemas

- `celerrate-json-report.v1.schema.json`: the contract for
  `celerrate check --output=json`, authored here. Compatibility policy:
  adding a field is non-breaking and updates this file in the same
  release; removing a field or changing its meaning increments
  `schema_version` and forks a new file. The test suite validates real
  output against this file.
- `sarif-2.1.0.schema.json`: the official SARIF 2.1.0 schema, committed
  verbatim so the validation gate runs without network access.
  Provenance:
  https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/schemas/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json
  (mirror: https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json). This schema
  is a normative component of the SARIF 2.1.0 Plus Errata 01 Work
  Product (the prose specification names it explicitly alongside the
  specification document itself), so it is covered by the same OASIS
  copyright and IPR terms as the specification. Those terms condition
  the right to copy and distribute on including both the copyright
  notice and the section that states the terms, so that section is
  reproduced verbatim below rather than only referenced, quoted from
  the specification's Appendix B, "Notices"
  (https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os.html):
